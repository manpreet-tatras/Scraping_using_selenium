      "PreS-Gr 3—\"I am a nonstop ball of energy. Powerful and full of light. I am a go-getter. A difference maker. A leader.\" Page after page of empowering text speaks to energetic children everywhere, as the author-illustrator team behind Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut return with another top-notch celebration of Black boys. The catchy text exudes confidence as different speakers energetically proclaim their competence at science and sports, as well as their creativity and perseverance. Background characters are of various races, but the stars of every page are Black, and they explore, soar, soak up information, and make a difference. The pace slows as the speaker admits he sometimes is afraid of what others call him but refuses to let those attitudes define him. The vibrant illustrations reinforce the energy as groups and individuals share their gifts with the world, including a cameo by Barack Obama. Remembering their ancestors and their fathers, and acknowledging their own strengths, a line of boys gaze at the reader before the book's final declaration, \"I am worthy to be loved.\" VERDICT Pulsing rhythms and bright images combine for a worthy and timely choice for every collection.—Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State Univ. Lib., Mankato\n",
      "Review\n",
      "* “A much-needed book for Black children when society demonstrates otherwise. The Kirkus Prize–, Coretta Scott King Honor–, Newbery Honor–, and Caldecott Honor–winning team behind Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut return for another celebration of Black excellence. In a text brimming with imagination and Black-boy joy, Barnes lays the foundation for young Black readers to go forth into the world filled with confidence and self-assurance. . . . Simultaneously, he opens a window for non-Black readers to see Black boys’ humanity. They have dreams, feel pain, are polite and respectful—the list of qualities goes on. Barnes also decides to address what is waiting for them as they experience the world. ‘I am not what they might call me.’ With this forceful statement, he provides a tool for building Black resilience, reassuring young Black readers that they are not those names. James supplies his customarily painterly art, his brushy oils painting Black boys of every shade of brown playing, celebrating, achieving, aspiring, and loving. Through every stroke readers will see that Black boys are ‘worthy / to be loved.’ The title says it all: Black boys are ‘every good thing.’”—Kirkus Reviews, starred review\n",
      "\n",
      "* “A powerful celebration of Black boyhood, countering many of the negative messages that a racist society puts forth about African American boys. Here they are adventurous, polite, inquisitive, playful, creative, artistic, athletic, brave, and worthy. They are also loving, vulnerable, and reliable. The text has a cadence that demands to be read out loud, performed, sung, or shouted with joy and veracity. James’ illustrations provide vibrant visualizations of the words, rich in color and movement. Boys’ brown faces radiate light, love, and the joyfulness of childhood so that readers can’t help but smile along as they read. . . . Despite this being intended for young readers, it would do no harm if it found its way into teenage hands as well, especially those already wounded by some of the predominant views of Black masculinity. . . . The need for a book like this, at a moment like this, could not be greater.”—Booklist, starred review\n",
      "\n",
      "* “Barnes and James reunite, after the multi-award-winning success of Crown, for this beautiful and necessary book that affirms Black boys and their right to thrive. James’s vibrant oil-paint illustrations harmoniously depict Black boys in motion, in contemplation, and in full vitality as they skateboard, swim, or stand contemplatively in the outdoors. Barnes’s refrain throughout the book . . . is a powerful, present-tense reminder that normalizes the robust lives Black boys deserve to live. . . . Lets Black boys know they are loved and valued just as they are, with unlimited possibilities. Movingly, one boy affirms for himself and for the reader, ‘I am not what they might call me, / and I will not answer to any name that is not my own.’ Fortunately, Barnes and James provide us with a range of powerful, positive names to call Black boys as they urge us to see them, to love them, and to let them live their lives as they deserve.”—Horn Book, starred review\n",

      "* “An empowering ode to Black boy joy. In metaphor-driven verse, Barnes moves from the interpersonally specific (‘I am that smile forming on your face’) to the iconic (‘I am a grand slam,/ bases fully loaded’), and from the naturalistic (‘I am waves crashing gently on the shore’) to the historical (‘I am my ancestors’ wildest dream’). Employing rich textures and jewel tones in his fine art style, James paints Black boys of varying skin tones and ages engaging in work and play, solo and in community. . . . Together, James’s energetic portraiture and Barnes’s affirming text powerfully and ecstatically convey the idea that all Black boys are ‘worthy/ to be loved.’”—Publishers Weekly, starred review\n",

      "I knew from Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut that Barnes and James are a powerhouse: positive, upbeat, and full of life. I Am Every Good Thing is such an incredibly positive and uplifting book, I had to read it to my own kids the day it arrived and to my two 3rd grade classes the day after - which is today. As a teacher, this books allows me to jump start important conversation around race and racism, identity, perceptions, stereotypes, and equity. This book provides an important mirror to my students of African ancestry, but it also provides a window and a segue to all of my students to understand the challenges Black men face daily. It is full of positive affirmations and I will make some of them part of my classroom culture. \"I am worthy of success, of respect, of safety, of happiness. I am worthy to be loved.\" Wow. The art is breathtaking. The verse flows from one page to the next. Hardly have I come across a book so perfect.\n",
      "I am every good thing is a celebration of Black boys and as the mother of a Black boy, this book hits home. My son can see himself in this book. He finds a shining piece of him on every page and for that I will be forever grateful!\n",

      "This book was very uplifting and highlighting the good things about being a boy. A book that is needed in these difficult times to show the world that our African American boys are just like all little boys. As a mother of an African American boy, these are the things that I would like the world to know about my child and not just what the media portrays him to be. Our African American boys are full of energy, go-getters, full of life, and leaders!! All the words and affirmations we should speak into them every day!!\n",

      "PreS-Gr 3—\"I am a nonstop ball of energy. Powerful and full of light. I am a go-getter. A difference maker. A leader.\" Page after page of empowering text speaks to energetic children everywhere, as the author-illustrator team behind Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut return with another top-notch celebration of Black boys. The catchy text exudes confidence as different speakers energetically proclaim their competence at science and sports, as well as their creativity and perseverance. Background characters are of various races, but the stars of every page are Black, and they explore, soar, soak up information, and make a difference. The pace slows as the speaker admits he sometimes is afraid of what others call him but refuses to let those attitudes define him. The vibrant illustrations reinforce the energy as groups and individuals share their gifts with the world, including a cameo by Barack Obama. Remembering their ancestors and their fathers, and acknowledging their own strengths, a line of boys gaze at the reader before the book's final declaration, \"I am worthy to be loved.\" VERDICT Pulsing rhythms and bright images combine for a worthy and timely choice for every collection.—Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State Univ. Lib., Mankato\n",
      "Review\n",
      "* “A much-needed book for Black children when society demonstrates otherwise. The Kirkus Prize–, Coretta Scott King Honor–, Newbery Honor–, and Caldecott Honor–winning team behind Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut return for another celebration of Black excellence. In a text brimming with imagination and Black-boy joy, Barnes lays the foundation for young Black readers to go forth into the world filled with confidence and self-assurance. . . . Simultaneously, he opens a window for non-Black readers to see Black boys’ humanity. They have dreams, feel pain, are polite and respectful—the list of qualities goes on. Barnes also decides to address what is waiting for them as they experience the world. ‘I am not what they might call me.’ With this forceful statement, he provides a tool for building Black resilience, reassuring young Black readers that they are not those names. James supplies his customarily painterly art, his brushy oils painting Black boys of every shade of brown playing, celebrating, achieving, aspiring, and loving. Through every stroke readers will see that Black boys are ‘worthy / to be loved.’ The title says it all: Black boys are ‘every good thing.’”—Kirkus Reviews, starred review\n",
      "\n",
      "* “A powerful celebration of Black boyhood, countering many of the negative messages that a racist society puts forth about African American boys. Here they are adventurous, polite, inquisitive, playful, creative, artistic, athletic, brave, and worthy. They are also loving, vulnerable, and reliable. The text has a cadence that demands to be read out loud, performed, sung, or shouted with joy and veracity. James’ illustrations provide vibrant visualizations of the words, rich in color and movement. Boys’ brown faces radiate light, love, and the joyfulness of childhood so that readers can’t help but smile along as they read. . . . Despite this being intended for young readers, it would do no harm if it found its way into teenage hands as well, especially those already wounded by some of the predominant views of Black masculinity. . . . The need for a book like this, at a moment like this, could not be greater.”—Booklist, starred review\n",
      "\n",
      "* “Barnes and James reunite, after the multi-award-winning success of Crown, for this beautiful and necessary book that affirms Black boys and their right to thrive. James’s vibrant oil-paint illustrations harmoniously depict Black boys in motion, in contemplation, and in full vitality as they skateboard, swim, or stand contemplatively in the outdoors. Barnes’s refrain throughout the book . . . is a powerful, present-tense reminder that normalizes the robust lives Black boys deserve to live. . . . Lets Black boys know they are loved and valued just as they are, with unlimited possibilities. Movingly, one boy affirms for himself and for the reader, ‘I am not what they might call me, / and I will not answer to any name that is not my own.’ Fortunately, Barnes and James provide us with a range of powerful, positive names to call Black boys as they urge us to see them, to love them, and to let them live their lives as they deserve.”—Horn Book, starred review\n",

      "* “An empowering ode to Black boy joy. In metaphor-driven verse, Barnes moves from the interpersonally specific (‘I am that smile forming on your face’) to the iconic (‘I am a grand slam,/ bases fully loaded’), and from the naturalistic (‘I am waves crashing gently on the shore’) to the historical (‘I am my ancestors’ wildest dream’). Employing rich textures and jewel tones in his fine art style, James paints Black boys of varying skin tones and ages engaging in work and play, solo and in community. . . . Together, James’s energetic portraiture and Barnes’s affirming text powerfully and ecstatically convey the idea that all Black boys are ‘worthy/ to be loved.’”—Publishers Weekly, starred review\n",

      "I knew from Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut that Barnes and James are a powerhouse: positive, upbeat, and full of life. I Am Every Good Thing is such an incredibly positive and uplifting book, I had to read it to my own kids the day it arrived and to my two 3rd grade classes the day after - which is today. As a teacher, this books allows me to jump start important conversation around race and racism, identity, perceptions, stereotypes, and equity. This book provides an important mirror to my students of African ancestry, but it also provides a window and a segue to all of my students to understand the challenges Black men face daily. It is full of positive affirmations and I will make some of them part of my classroom culture. \"I am worthy of success, of respect, of safety, of happiness. I am worthy to be loved.\" Wow. The art is breathtaking. The verse flows from one page to the next. Hardly have I come across a book so perfect.\n",
      "I am every good thing is a celebration of Black boys and as the mother of a Black boy, this book hits home. My son can see himself in this book. He finds a shining piece of him on every page and for that I will be forever grateful!\n",

      "PreS-Gr 3—\"I am a nonstop ball of energy. Powerful and full of light. I am a go-getter. A difference maker. A leader.\" Page after page of empowering text speaks to energetic children everywhere, as the author-illustrator team behind Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut return with another top-notch celebration of Black boys. The catchy text exudes confidence as different speakers energetically proclaim their competence at science and sports, as well as their creativity and perseverance. Background characters are of various races, but the stars of every page are Black, and they explore, soar, soak up information, and make a difference. The pace slows as the speaker admits he sometimes is afraid of what others call him but refuses to let those attitudes define him. The vibrant illustrations reinforce the energy as groups and individuals share their gifts with the world, including a cameo by Barack Obama. Remembering their ancestors and their fathers, and acknowledging their own strengths, a line of boys gaze at the reader before the book's final declaration, \"I am worthy to be loved.\" VERDICT Pulsing rhythms and bright images combine for a worthy and timely choice for every collection.—Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State Univ. Lib., Mankato\n",
      "Review\n",
      "* “A much-needed book for Black children when society demonstrates otherwise. The Kirkus Prize–, Coretta Scott King Honor–, Newbery Honor–, and Caldecott Honor–winning team behind Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut return for another celebration of Black excellence. In a text brimming with imagination and Black-boy joy, Barnes lays the foundation for young Black readers to go forth into the world filled with confidence and self-assurance. . . . Simultaneously, he opens a window for non-Black readers to see Black boys’ humanity. They have dreams, feel pain, are polite and respectful—the list of qualities goes on. Barnes also decides to address what is waiting for them as they experience the world. ‘I am not what they might call me.’ With this forceful statement, he provides a tool for building Black resilience, reassuring young Black readers that they are not those names. James supplies his customarily painterly art, his brushy oils painting Black boys of every shade of brown playing, celebrating, achieving, aspiring, and loving. Through every stroke readers will see that Black boys are ‘worthy / to be loved.’ The title says it all: Black boys are ‘every good thing.’”—Kirkus Reviews, starred review\n",
      "\n",
      "* “A powerful celebration of Black boyhood, countering many of the negative messages that a racist society puts forth about African American boys. Here they are adventurous, polite, inquisitive, playful, creative, artistic, athletic, brave, and worthy. They are also loving, vulnerable, and reliable. The text has a cadence that demands to be read out loud, performed, sung, or shouted with joy and veracity. James’ illustrations provide vibrant visualizations of the words, rich in color and movement. Boys’ brown faces radiate light, love, and the joyfulness of childhood so that readers can’t help but smile along as they read. . . . Despite this being intended for young readers, it would do no harm if it found its way into teenage hands as well, especially those already wounded by some of the predominant views of Black masculinity. . . . The need for a book like this, at a moment like this, could not be greater.”—Booklist, starred review\n",
      "\n",
      "* “Barnes and James reunite, after the multi-award-winning success of Crown, for this beautiful and necessary book that affirms Black boys and their right to thrive. James’s vibrant oil-paint illustrations harmoniously depict Black boys in motion, in contemplation, and in full vitality as they skateboard, swim, or stand contemplatively in the outdoors. Barnes’s refrain throughout the book . . . is a powerful, present-tense reminder that normalizes the robust lives Black boys deserve to live. . . . Lets Black boys know they are loved and valued just as they are, with unlimited possibilities. Movingly, one boy affirms for himself and for the reader, ‘I am not what they might call me, / and I will not answer to any name that is not my own.’ Fortunately, Barnes and James provide us with a range of powerful, positive names to call Black boys as they urge us to see them, to love them, and to let them live their lives as they deserve.”—Horn Book, starred review\n",

      "* “An empowering ode to Black boy joy. In metaphor-driven verse, Barnes moves from the interpersonally specific (‘I am that smile forming on your face’) to the iconic (‘I am a grand slam,/ bases fully loaded’), and from the naturalistic (‘I am waves crashing gently on the shore’) to the historical (‘I am my ancestors’ wildest dream’). Employing rich textures and jewel tones in his fine art style, James paints Black boys of varying skin tones and ages engaging in work and play, solo and in community. . . . Together, James’s energetic portraiture and Barnes’s affirming text powerfully and ecstatically convey the idea that all Black boys are ‘worthy/ to be loved.’”—Publishers Weekly, starred review\n",

      "I knew from Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut that Barnes and James are a powerhouse: positive, upbeat, and full of life. I Am Every Good Thing is such an incredibly positive and uplifting book, I had to read it to my own kids the day it arrived and to my two 3rd grade classes the day after - which is today. As a teacher, this books allows me to jump start important conversation around race and racism, identity, perceptions, stereotypes, and equity. This book provides an important mirror to my students of African ancestry, but it also provides a window and a segue to all of my students to understand the challenges Black men face daily. It is full of positive affirmations and I will make some of them part of my classroom culture. \"I am worthy of success, of respect, of safety, of happiness. I am worthy to be loved.\" Wow. The art is breathtaking. The verse flows from one page to the next. Hardly have I come across a book so perfect.\n",
      "I am every good thing is a celebration of Black boys and as the mother of a Black boy, this book hits home. My son can see himself in this book. He finds a shining piece of him on every page and for that I will be forever grateful!\n",

A book that is needed in these difficult times to show the world that our African American boys are just like all little boys. As a mother of an African American boy, these are the things that I would like the world to know about my child and not just what the media portrays him to be. Our African American boys are full of energy, go-getters, full of life, and leaders!! All the words and affirmations we should speak into them every day!!\n",

      "* “A much-needed book for Black children when society demonstrates otherwise. The Kirkus Prize–, Coretta Scott King Honor–, Newbery Honor–, and Caldecott Honor–winning team behind Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut return for another celebration of Black excellence. In a text brimming with imagination and Black-boy joy, Barnes lays the foundation for young Black readers to go forth into the world filled with confidence and self-assurance. . . . Simultaneously, he opens a window for non-Black readers to see Black boys’ humanity. They have dreams, feel pain, are polite and respectful—the list of qualities goes on. Barnes also decides to address what is waiting for them as they experience the world. ‘I am not what they might call me.’ With this forceful statement, he provides a tool for building Black resilience, reassuring young Black readers that they are not those names. James supplies his customarily painterly art, his brushy oils painting Black boys of every shade of brown playing, celebrating, achieving, aspiring, and loving. Through every stroke readers will see that Black boys are ‘worthy / to be loved.’ The title says it all: Black boys are ‘every good thing.’”—Kirkus Reviews, starred review\n",

      "* “A powerful celebration of Black boyhood, countering many of the negative messages that a racist society puts forth about African American boys. Here they are adventurous, polite, inquisitive, playful, creative, artistic, athletic, brave, and worthy. They are also loving, vulnerable, and reliable. The text has a cadence that demands to be read out loud, performed, sung, or shouted with joy and veracity. James’ illustrations provide vibrant visualizations of the words, rich in color and movement. Boys’ brown faces radiate light, love, and the joyfulness of childhood so that readers can’t help but smile along as they read. . . . Despite this being intended for young readers, it would do no harm if it found its way into teenage hands as well, especially those already wounded by some of the predominant views of Black masculinity. . . . The need for a book like this, at a moment like this, could not be greater.”—Booklist, starred review\n",
      "\n",
      "* “Barnes and James reunite, after the multi-award-winning success of Crown, for this beautiful and necessary book that affirms Black boys and their right to thrive. James’s vibrant oil-paint illustrations harmoniously depict Black boys in motion, in contemplation, and in full vitality as they skateboard, swim, or stand contemplatively in the outdoors. Barnes’s refrain throughout the book . . . is a powerful, present-tense reminder that normalizes the robust lives Black boys deserve to live. . . . Lets Black boys know they are loved and valued just as they are, with unlimited possibilities. Movingly, one boy affirms for himself and for the reader, ‘I am not what they might call me, / and I will not answer to any name that is not my own.’ Fortunately, Barnes and James provide us with a range of powerful, positive names to call Black boys as they urge us to see them, to love them, and to let them live their lives as they deserve.”—Horn Book, starred review\n",

Employing rich textures and jewel tones in his fine art style, James paints Black boys of varying skin tones and ages engaging in work and play, solo and in community. . . .

The Kirkus Prize–, Coretta Scott King Honor–, Newbery Honor–, and Caldecott Honor–winning team behind Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut return for another celebration of Black excellence. In a text brimming with imagination and Black-boy joy, Barnes lays the foundation for young Black readers to go forth into the world filled with confidence and self-assurance. . . . Simultaneously, he opens a window for non-Black readers to see Black boys’ humanity. They have dreams, feel pain, are polite and respectful—the list of qualities goes on. Barnes also decides to address what is waiting for them as they experience the world. ‘I am not what they might call me.’ With this forceful statement, he provides a tool for building Black resilience, reassuring young Black readers that they are not those names. James supplies his customarily painterly art, his brushy oils painting Black boys of every shade of brown playing, celebrating, achieving, aspiring, and loving. Through every stroke readers will see that Black boys are ‘worthy / to be loved.’ The title says it all: Black boys are ‘every good thing.’”—Kirkus Reviews, starred review\n",

      "* “A powerful celebration of Black boyhood, countering many of the negative messages that a racist society puts forth about African American boys. Here they are adventurous, polite, inquisitive, playful, creative, artistic, athletic, brave, and worthy. They are also loving, vulnerable, and reliable. The text has a cadence that demands to be read out loud, performed, sung, or shouted with joy and veracity. James’ illustrations provide vibrant visualizations of the words, rich in color and movement. Boys’ brown faces radiate light, love, and the joyfulness of childhood so that readers can’t help but smile along as they read. . . . Despite this being intended for young readers, it would do no harm if it found its way into teenage hands as well, especially those already wounded by some of the predominant views of Black masculinity. . . . The need for a book like this, at a moment like this, could not be greater.”—Booklist, starred review\n",

      "* “Barnes and James reunite, after the multi-award-winning success of Crown, for this beautiful and necessary book that affirms Black boys and their right to thrive. James’s vibrant oil-paint illustrations harmoniously depict Black boys in motion, in contemplation, and in full vitality as they skateboard, swim, or stand contemplatively in the outdoors. Barnes’s refrain throughout the book . . . is a powerful, present-tense reminder that normalizes the robust lives Black boys deserve to live. . . . Lets Black boys know they are loved and valued just as they are, with unlimited possibilities. Movingly, one boy affirms for himself and for the reader, ‘I am not what they might call me, / and I will not answer to any name that is not my own.’ Fortunately, Barnes and James provide us with a range of powerful, positive names to call Black boys as they urge us to see them, to love them, and to let them live their lives as they deserve.”—Horn Book, starred review\n",

      "* “Page after page of empowering text speaks to energetic children everywhere, as the author-illustrator team behind Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut return with another top-notch celebration of Black boys. The catchy text exudes confidence. . . . Background characters are of various races, but the stars of every page are Black, and they explore, soar, soak up information, and make a difference. The pace slows as the speaker admits he sometimes is afraid of what others call him but refuses to let those attitudes define him.  The vibrant illustrations reinforce the energy as groups and individuals share their gifts with the world, including a cameo by Barack Obama. Remembering their ancestors and their fathers, and acknowledging their own strengths, a line of boys gaze at the reader before the book’s final declaration. . . . Pulsing rhythms and bright images combine for a worthy and timely choice for every collection.”—School Library Journal, starred review\n",

      "* “An empowering ode to Black boy joy. In metaphor-driven verse, Barnes moves from the interpersonally specific (‘I am that smile forming on your face’) to the iconic (‘I am a grand slam,/ bases fully loaded’), and from the naturalistic (‘I am waves crashing gently on the shore’) to the historical (‘I am my ancestors’ wildest dream’). Employing rich textures and jewel tones in his fine art style, James paints Black boys of varying skin tones and ages engaging in work and play, solo and in community. . . . Together, James’s energetic portraiture and Barnes’s affirming text powerfully and ecstatically convey the idea that all Black boys are ‘worthy/ to be loved.’”—Publishers Weekly, starred review\n",

      "I knew from Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut that Barnes and James are a powerhouse: positive, upbeat, and full of life. I Am Every Good Thing is such an incredibly positive and uplifting book, I had to read it to my own kids the day it arrived and to my two 3rd grade classes the day after - which is today. As a teacher, this books allows me to jump start important conversation around race and racism, identity, perceptions, stereotypes, and equity. This book provides an important mirror to my students of African ancestry, but it also provides a window and a segue to all of my students to understand the challenges Black men face daily. It is full of positive affirmations and I will make some of them part of my classroom culture. \"I am worthy of success, of respect, of safety, of happiness. I am worthy to be loved.\" Wow. The art is breathtaking. The verse flows from one page to the next. Hardly have I come across a book so perfect.\n",
      "I am every good thing is a celebration of Black boys and as the mother of a Black boy, this book hits home. My son can see himself in this book. He finds a shining piece of him on every page and for that I will be forever grateful!\n",

      "Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020\n",
      "Verified Purchase\n",
      "This book was very uplifting and highlighting the good things about being a boy. A book that is needed in these difficult times to show the world that our African American boys are just like all little boys. As a mother of an African American boy, these are the things that I would like the world to know about my child and not just what the media portrays him to be. Our African American boys are full of energy, go-getters, full of life, and leaders!! All the words and affirmations we should speak into them every day!!\n",

      "I knew from Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut that Barnes and James are a powerhouse: positive, upbeat, and full of life. I Am Every Good Thing is such an incredibly positive and uplifting book, I had to read it to my own kids the day it arrived and to my two 3rd grade classes the day after - which is today. As a teacher, this books allows me to jump start important conversation around race and racism, identity, perceptions, stereotypes, and equity. This book provides an important mirror to my students of African ancestry, but it also provides a window and a segue to all of my students to understand the challenges Black men face daily. It is full of positive affirmations and I will make some of them part of my classroom culture. \"I am worthy of success, of respect, of safety, of happiness. I am worthy to be loved.\" Wow. The art is breathtaking. The verse flows from one page to the next. Hardly have I come across a book so perfect.\n",

      "I knew from Crown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut that Barnes and James are a powerhouse: positive, upbeat, and full of life. I Am Every Good Thing is such an incredibly positive and uplifting book, I had to read it to my own kids the day it arrived and to my two 3rd grade classes the day after - which is today. As a teacher, this books allows me to jump start important conversation around race and racism, identity, perceptions, stereotypes, and equity. This book provides an important mirror to my students of African ancestry, but it also provides a window and a segue to all of my students to understand the challenges Black men face daily. It is full of positive affirmations and I will make some of them part of my classroom culture. \"I am worthy of success, of respect, of safety, of happiness. I am worthy to be loved.\" Wow. The art is breathtaking. The verse flows from one page to the next. Hardly have I come across a book so perfect.\n",

      "This book was very uplifting and highlighting the good things about being a boy. A book that is needed in these difficult times to show the world that our African American boys are just like all little boys. As a mother of an African American boy, these are the things that I would like the world to know about my child and not just what the media portrays him to be. Our African American boys are full of energy, go-getters, full of life, and leaders!! All the words and affirmations we should speak into them every day!!\n",

    "## Locating by XPath\n",
    "XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. As HTML can be an implementation of XML (XHTML), Selenium users can leverage this powerful language to target elements in their web applications. XPath supports the simple methods of locating by id or name attributes and extends them by opening up all sorts of new possibilities such as locating the third checkbox on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don’t have a suitable id or name attribute for the element you wish to locate. You can use XPath to either locate the element in absolute terms (not advised), or relative to an element that does have an id or name attribute. XPath locators can also be used to specify elements via attributes other than id and name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (html) and as a result are likely to fail with only the slightest adjustment to the application. By finding a nearby element with an id or name attribute (ideally a parent element) you can locate your target element based on the relationship. This is much less likely to change and can make your tests more robust.\n",
